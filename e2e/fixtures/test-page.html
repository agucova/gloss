			<h1>Test Article for Highlighting</h1>
			<p id="para-1">
				This is the first paragraph with some text that can be highlighted. It
				contains enough content to form a meaningful selection for testing
				purposes.
			</p>
			<p id="para-2">
				The second paragraph has different content. Knowledge workers often
				highlight text for retention and reference while browsing the web.
			</p>
			<p id="para-3">
				A third paragraph ensures we can test multiple highlights on the same
				page without overlap issues. Each paragraph is uniquely identifiable.
